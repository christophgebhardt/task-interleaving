## Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Model
### Setup

## Data
To be published soon.

## Model Fitting with Approximate Bayesian Computation
To fit the HRL model to a specific user in our dataset, you can use [ELFI](https://elfi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and follow the approach descriped in [1]. The code of our fitting procedure will be published soon.
